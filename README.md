Recognizing human activities from video sequences or still images is a challenging task due to problems, such as background clutter, partial occlusion, changes in scale, viewpoint, lighting, and appearance. Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model. Human Activity Recognition plays a significant role in human-to-human and human-computer interaction. Manually driven system are highly time consuming and costlier. So, to design a Human activity recognition system becomes a need for this current world scenario. This system will not only be cost effective but also as a utility-based system that can be incorporated in a large number of applications that will save time and aid in various activities that require recognition process, and save a lot of time with good accuracy. In this project, KTH video dataset is used for designing the system. Preprocessing technique is used to extract the certain frames. In feature extraction process, Pixel and Optical flow feature extraction techniques are used to extract the features. Data visualization method is used for visualize the feature extraction. The deep learning algorithm such as Spatio-Temporal Net is then used to determine and classify the activities of a human. We can provide this efficient model as an application to road surveillance as such a camera module fixed in the road to perform constant surveillance. The camera on recognizing abnormality in the humans such as fights, etc., an alert notification is sent to the police. A mobile application is developed using react native which will be held by the police to which, the camera on recognizing abnormal actions from a human an alert notification is sent and live streaming is enabled. Thus, this project successfully provides a Human activity recognition model incorporating AI to the cameras which can be used in real time applications such as a solution to prevent and provide evidence of an abnormal detection in road.

WORKING

In this project, we are going to determine the human activity recognition by which we can effectively identify the human activity in road by which if an abnormal action can be determined. So, the first step in the project will be collecting the dataset from KTH video dataset and then we will be separating these datasets into training as well as testing dataset where the testing dataset will be kept separate and the training dataset will be used to train the model. Then these datasets are pre-processed using different techniques to align the datasets into single dimensions. After data preprocessing, in feature extraction process, Pixel and Optical flow feature extraction techniques are used to extract the features. Then, Data Visualization method is used for visualize the feature extraction. After Data Visualization, we will be ready for training with the architecture. The deep learning algorithm such as Spatio-Temporal Net is then used to determine and classify the activities of a human. We can provide this efficient model as an application to road surveillance as such a camera module fixed in the road to perform constant surveillance. The camera on recognizing abnormality in the humans such as fights, etc., an alert notification is sent to the police. A mobile application is developed using react native which will be held by the police to which, the camera on recognizing abnormal actions from a human an alert notification is sent and live streaming is enabled. Thus, this project successfully provides a Human activity recognition model incorporating AI to the cameras which can be used in real time applications such as a solution to prevent and provide evidence of an abnormal detection in road.
